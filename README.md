## About Trippy Ninja
Trippy Ninja is a project to port the V2 API server, written in PHP, to CoffeeScript + Node.JS. The idea came from a bug in the V2 API server which was almost impossible to fix with PHP. We were also looking for better performance, module availability, and code readability

## Project Status
Trippy Ninja is currently being actively developed by [jj56](https://github.com/jj56), and scheduled for release within the next month.

We would be glad to accept any feature requests, bug reports, or pull requests.
